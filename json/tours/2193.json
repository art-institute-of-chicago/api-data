    "intro_transcript": "<p>Hello and Welcome to the Art Institute of Chicago. I\u2019m Nenette Luarca- Shouaf, Associate Curator of Education, Learning, and Interpretation. On this tour, you\u2019ll learn about some of the museum\u2019s most iconic paintings and sculptures. You\u2019ll also be introduced to some treasures that aren\u2019t so well-known. You\u2019ll see artworks from 19th century France, the Aztec empire, a royal palace in Nigeria, and the United States just before World War II, among others. These artworks represent the breadth and depth of the Art Institute\u2019s collection, which celebrates the rich cultural heritage and artist achievements of peoples all over the world. Our curators and researchers will be your guides and help to explain what you\u2019re seeing. In some cases, the artists themselves offer insights on how they reproached making the works. There\u2019s no right way to take this tour. You can follow the itinerary that we have provided or explore at your own pace in any order. The tour takes you upstairs and downstairs, from our historic Michigan Avenue building into the Modern Wing, and everywhere in between. Since the Art Institute was founded in 1879, the museum has been a source of pride for Chicago. We\u2019re glad that you\u2019ve decided to visit and we hope that it\u2019s just one of many that you make in the future.</p>\n",
