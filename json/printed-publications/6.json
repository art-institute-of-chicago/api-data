    "copy": " In 1979, when African-American photographer Dawoud Bey showed twenty-five photographs at the Studio Museum in Harlem under the heading Harlem U.S.A ., the exhibition offered a young artist\u2019s vision of a moment in the neighborhood\u2019s life. Published here as a complete set for the first time, Dawoud Bey: Harlem U.S.A. also includes five previously unpublished photographs from the same period. Bey\u2019s vintage images are given new context in an essay by emerging African American writer Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, who undertook her own fascinating study of Harlem in 2011. Bey, who grew up in Queens with family roots in Harlem, has become one of the most widely acclaimed portraitists on the contemporary scene. This handsome book, with faithful duotone reproductions, provides a wonderful opportunity to revisit a classic portfolio of images that still resonates in today\u2019s culture.   Edited by Matthew S. Witkovsky With an essay by Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts   88 pages, 8 1/2 x 11 in. 50 duotone ills. Out of print ISBN: 978-0-300-18126-5 (hardcover) ",
