    "copy": " Pissarro Paintings and Works on Paper at the Art Institute of Chicago is the museum\u2019s fourth volume in its digital series on the Impressionist circle. It features ten paintings and seven works on paper from across the artist\u2019s career, including\u2014uniquely among major museums\u2014both a painting and one of its preparatory drawings. The curatorial and conservation entries, which include new high-resolution photography, draw fascinating connections between Pissarro\u2019s life and work, and offer novel insights into his technique, showing how he consistently pushed Impressionist approaches in new directions.   Edited by Gloria Groom and Genevieve Westerby; essays by Richard R. Brettel, Kelly Keegan, Kimberly Nichols, and Kirk Vuillemot   The Pissarro project has received generous funding from the Mellon Foundation as well as the Art Institute\u2019s David and Mary Winton Green Nineteenth-Century Research Fund. The catalogues were built using the OSCI Toolkit , an open-source, digital publishing platform. ",
