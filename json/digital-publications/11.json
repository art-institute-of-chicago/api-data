    "copy": " This volume, the first in the online series The Impressionist Circle at the Art Institute of Chicago , features forty-seven works by Monet. Entries on the paintings and drawings include new art historical research and unprecedented high-resolution imaging that allows readers to zoom in to see the artist\u2019s brushstrokes, as well as previously unpublished technical photography that unveils information hidden beneath the surface of the artwork through interactive, layered images showing X-ray, infrared, and other technical imaging. Conservation reports on each artwork offer in-depth studies of the artist\u2019s process and incorporate new scientific data on his materials. Other features include a glossary, scanned archival materials, and biographical information about significant historical collectors for the museum.   Edited by Gloria Groom and Jill Shaw; essays by James Ganz, Gloria Groom, Nancy Ireson, Dawn Jaros, Kimberley Muir, Kimberly Nichols, and Jill Shaw; contributions by Inge Fiedler and Genevieve Westerby   Funded by the Getty Foundation and the Art Institute\u2019s David and Mary Winton Green Nineteenth-Century Research Fund, with additional staffing support from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation and scientific research support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, this catalogue is part of the Getty Foundation\u2019s Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI). ",
