Taken together, these extraordinary examples reflect the development of America\u2019s national identity and its diverse cultural influences, demonstrate technological advances, and celebrate innovative modes of aesthetic experimentation. The museum\u2019s Department of American Art has long been committed to researching and publishing extensive new scholarship surrounding its varied holdings. Their efforts over the last decades have resulted in volumes such as American Art at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1700\u20131914; Shaping the Modern: American Decorative Arts at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1917\u201365; American Modernism at the Art Institute of Chicago; The Age of American Impressionism; and For Kith and Kin: The Folk Art Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago. American Silver in the Art Institute of Chicago is the first such volume to be realized in print and in digital form, augmenting the museum\u2019s strong program of digital scholarly publishing.\n\nI would like to thank Judith A. Barter, former Field-McCormick Chair and Curator of American Art, for initiating this valuable project and Elizabeth McGoey, Ann S. and Samuel M. Mencoff Assistant Curator of American Decorative Arts, for stewarding its execution. The rigor and enthusiasm they brought to this volume are echoed in the insightful contributions made by leading experts: Debra Schmidt Bach, David L. Barquist, Jennifer Goldsborough, Medill Higgins Harvey, Patricia Kane, Barbara K. Schnitzer, Janine E. Skerry, Ann Wagner, Gerald W. R. Ward, Deborah Dependahl Waters, Beth Carver Wees, and Elizabeth A. Williams.\n\nThe catalogue has also benefited from the generous contributions of those who share our institution\u2019s vision and passion for American material culture, including the Community Associates of the Art Institute of Chicago, Mr. and Mrs. Henry M. Buchbinder, Carl and Marilynn Thoma, Louise Ingersoll Tausche, Jamee and Marshall Field V, Kay Bucksbaum, Celia and David Hilliard, and Jan and Bill Jentes.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to the Henry Luce Foundation, which in the past graciously funded American Art at the Art Institute of Chicago and American Modernism and has again offered its visionary support for this interactive publication and the splendid print catalogue that preceded it. The Art Institute has established itself as a leader in collection-focused digital publishing, and our hope is that this resource builds on the discoveries within the print publication, ensuring the availability of innovative and in-depth analysis of our American silver holdings for curators, scholars, collectors, and museum audiences worldwide.  \n\nJames Rondeau  \nPresident and Eloise W. Martin Director  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago\n\n</section>",
