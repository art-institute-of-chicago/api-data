By that point his work had already been included with some regularity in these official, government-sponsored, juried exhibitions, where it went on to enjoy even greater success in the four years to come. This was partly because the artist\u2019s colleague and mentor, Charles Daubigny, was a regular juror who advocated fiercely to admit the submissions of young, progressive landscape painters such as Pissarro and Claude Monet.\n\nPissarro\u2019s earliest Salon painting was a small canvas accepted in 1859, when he was not yet twenty-nine years old. Painted around 1858 (PDRS 37) it was entitled Donkey in Front of a Farm, Montmorency (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). If the artist submitted to the Salons of 1860\u201362, there is no record of it, but he was represented in the Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1863 by all three of his submissions, which were laconically entitled Paysage (Landscape), \u00c9tude (Study), and Village. Although none of these have been identified, it is not difficult to propose candidates from the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 and, given the fact that all his other 1860s Salon paintings survive, it is likely that all three of these are known today. The Salon landscapes of 18\u201366 were larger in scale than any of his earlier submissions, showing a new confidence and ambition. They represent the countryside near the small rural towns of Varenne-Saint-Maure, Varenne-Saint-Hilaire, Chennevi\u00e8res, and Champigny, all just east of Paris along the looping Marne River before it merges with the Seine.\n\nDuring the three years Pissarro painted in this region, he tended to work there in the summer and to spend the rest of the year in Paris, where he shared a studio with various artists or rented a small space of his own. Although unmarried at the time, he shared his life with Julie Vellay, with whom he already had two small children and whom he would later wed. Despite his own parents\u2019 economic security and the financial support they gave him, the artist struggled financially and moved frequently during these years, even settling back in with his parents before his father died in January 1865. Nonetheless, much of each year was spent in the aforementioned villages. La Varenne-Saint-Hilaire, where Pissarro\u2019s second child, Jeanne, was born in May 1865, was the first French landscape that he explored in depth. It seems likely that he and his family lived here well into the winter of 1865 before moving again to Paris and then to a house in L\u2019Hermitage, a district of the ancient town of Pontoise, northwest of Paris. This was probably in April 1866, the month before the Salon in which the Art Institute\u2019s painting first appeared.\n\nIt is important first to place The Banks of the Marne in Winter in the context of Pissarro\u2019s Salon canvases of the previous two years, during which he truly came into his own as a painter. In 1864 the clearly identified Salon submission is a very dour, featureless landscape of a rutted dirt road, a chemin de halage (or pathway for the horses that pulled barges), along the Marne (fig. 2.1 [PDRS 90]). The trees are utterly banal, there is no topography of interest, and a distant poplar constitutes the only vertical accent. The sky is similarly unremarkable, and a single female rural worker is set in the landscape as the road bends with the river. In short, the painting has nothing to recommend it as a landscape view: no important buildings, no piles of cumulus clouds, no specimen trees, no moving boats. It is, rather, an antipicturesque picture painted largely with a palette knife in the manner of the radical Gustave Courbet but with none of his rocky or forested scenery. The second picture Pissarro submitted in 1864, entitled Road to Cachalas at La Roche-Guyon, has never been identified but was surely a representation of a rural road near the beautiful town to the west of Paris.\n\nPissarro\u2019s major submission to the 1865 Salon was considerably more ingratiating. It represented a broad stretch of the Marne near the village of Chennevi\u00e8res (fig. 2.2 [PDRS 103]). Composed in a manner designed to evoke\u2014and thus please\u2014Daubigny, the advocate for the vanguard landscape painters on the Salon jury, it was accepted along with an as-yet-unidentified landscape entitled The Shore, which may well have been the signed but undated landscape presently known as Barges on the Seine (fig. 2.3 [PDRS 79]), representing a stretch of the Seine near La Roche-Guyon. Both are primarily constructed with a palette knife and depict landscapes on pleasant, sunny days with buildings and boats as well as human figures. They are at once tough in their aggressive facture and, by comparison with the 1864 submission, appealing in their content. Moreover, at the 1865 Salon, held in May, they would have been a welcome hint of the summer season just around the corner. These two pictures, with good weather, boats, and even subtle associations with rural leisure\u2014particularly evident in Banks of the Marne in Chennevi\u00e8res\u2014anticipate the Impressionist river landscapes of the next decade, but they prepare us little for the utter bleakness of The Banks of the Marne in Winter.\n\nThis painting is among the least approachable Salon landscapes of the 1860s. The season, as we are told and can easily see, is winter, not the charming summertime that Pissarro had investigated the previous year. The Marne is devoid of any life. The recently planted poplar trees are bare of leaves and stand like frigid lines in the landscape. The woman (perhaps Julie Vellay) and the tiny child (maybe her and Camille\u2019s three-year-old son, Lucien) trudge along the path, presumably heading home (fig. 2.4). The hillside across from the river is brown and gray; the sky is filled with heavy, rain-laden clouds; and the distance between the figures and the nearest house is great enough to cause worry. Will they make it to cover before the rain comes, and if not, where will they find shelter in this open field if it starts to thunder? Yet at the same time, the brilliant green of the grass in the field imparts some sense of renewal or hope to this deathly, almost Symbolist landscape. It seems as though Pissarro was expressing one major idea in this work: nature\u2019s glory and ability to persevere season by season, as portrayed by the dark, looming clouds and lush green grass in the foreground, perhaps representative of the cycles of life and death. That stunning, almost blinding patch of green may appear effortlessly rendered, but it was most certainly carefully orchestrated to deliver a powerful effect, to arrest viewers\u2019 attention through the sheer physicality of its beauty, a beauty that only an artist intimately familiar with the rural landscape could fully convey.\n\nThe painting\u2019s theme may also relate to Pissarro\u2019s personal life, which had not been easy the previous year, when he began to think about his Salon submission. After his father\u2019s death, his half-sister had left Paris with her children, leaving Pissarro\u2019s emotionally needy widowed mother, Rachel, in the care of her two sons. Rachel had not relented in her rejection of her son\u2019s partner, a Christian, working-class woman who may have struck her as inappropriate because the Pissarros were not only wealthier but also Jewish. Yet in spite of their comparative well-off status and the painter\u2019s increasing acceptance as an artist through his Salon submissions, the young family had severe financial problems.\n\nPerhaps for all these reasons, Pissarro, Vellay, and their children remained in more affordable Varenne-Saint-Hilaire throughout the winter of 1865\u201366 rather than returning to Paris as they usually did. This choice had ramifications for Pissarro\u2019s art; he began, during that time, to capture effects of autumn and winter usually neglected by Paris-based landscape painters, who tended to paint the countryside only during the June through September \u201cseason.\u201d This acceptance of the countryside as a permanent condition of life was not new for Pissarro, who had never lived in an urban environment except as a child and only worked as an artist in the city very late in his career. Presumably his embrace of the rural life, with which Vellay was familiar, was thus not a struggle, which would explain his understanding of and formal relationship with the country landscapes he painted. The Art Institute\u2019s picture is a fine example, able to stir an emotional response and capture viewers\u2019 attention through the formal elements of compositional arrangement and color.\n\nIt is not known when he began to plan his Salon landscape for 1866, but its winter subject tells us that he worked on it most concertedly at the end of the previous year. The vibrant russet tones in the underlayers of the foreground (like the colors in the painted sketch) argue for a work period beginning in the fall (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report). The Salon in Paris was then held in May, and Pissarro\u2019s 1864 and 1865 pictures had fared well enough that he surely wanted to make a serious contribution to the 1866 Salon by duplicating the working process he had employed for his 1864 submission, Banks of the Marne. We know from X-ray examination of the canvas that Pissarro originally started Banks of the Marne in Winter in a different part of the region near Varenne, because the hills in the X-ray are so different from those in the final picture, suggesting that all that survives of the original landscape is the horizon line, portions of the sky, and its horizontal format. The painting\u2019s undercomposition (see fig. 2.5) recalls other works Pissarro made in the area, with a clump of large foliage at the left tucked into a hillside and what appears to be a path with a river beside it, like Banks of the Marne (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report). A small oil sketch for the picture does survive (fig. 2.6 [PDRS 106]), and it is fascinating to compare it to the final painting, because it seems to have been made earlier in the year, when the trees still had brown and orange-brown leaves, giving it the quality of an effet d\u2019automne; these colors also appear in the underlayer of the painting\u2019s foreground (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report). There is no oil study with the same folded hills as those in the Art Institute\u2019s painting\u2019s first stage, and it is likely that Pissarro began to work on the picture in the summer of 1865, then modified it in the fall and winter of that year, giving the final product a brighter overall effect, perhaps even in anticipation of submitting it to the Salon.\n\nIn a letter to his friend the Puerto Rican painter Francisco Oller in December 1865, Pissarro stated that he and his family planned to remain in Varenne-Saint-Hilaire until April 1866. But, at least by then, and perhaps as early as January 1866, the Pissarros had moved to L\u2019Hermitage. The artist was to work there for over fifteen years. Possibly, he had a lease in Varenne that came due and, given his financial circumstances as well as the demands of his career, he may have needed to find another inexpensive place near Paris where his growing family could live and where the thrifty Julie could keep a garden and barnyard animals to trim their expenses even further and bring in some additional income. It is, however, equally likely that Pissarro needed a change of scenery in order to pursue his aesthetic concerns, the east of Paris having become perhaps too dull. He may have selected Pontoise not only for its rural scenery but also because he was familiar with the area from having previously worked in Montmorency. As we know from the wealth of pictures that he created in Pontoise over the years, there Pissarro found his artistic paradise, so to speak.\n\nIn short, the Pissarros had moved from one side of Paris to the other in the early months of 1866, before the Salon in which The Banks of the Marne in Winter was first shown. It is likely that the painting was completed either in L\u2019Hermitage or in a borrowed Parisian studio (possibly that of Antoine Guillemet, with whom Pissarro was in close touch and to whom he suggested that Oller send mail to him between moves). Even if the Chicago painting was begun outdoors, it was most likely finished in the Pontoise studio. This goes a long way to explaining the picture\u2019s almost abstract quality, its sense of being a structured rather than an experienced landscape. And the likelihood that the brilliant green grass that dominates the lower right of the composition was added very late in the painting process, presumably as an adjustment motivated purely by formal concerns, emphasizes the image\u2019s controlled and ordered quality. Pissarro worked on the picture without being able to compare it with the landscape itself, and even he must have had to admit that its utter dourness revealed that the rather Courbet-like slab of viridian green was introduced not in Varenne-Saint-Hilaire but in distant Pontoise, where he was already excitedly planning his next landscapes. This may indicate that the actual season represented was not winter at all, as the grass\u2014frozen after having turned brown in the fall (see fig. 2.5)\u2014would have only turned green in the spring.\n\nAn undeniable specter of death hangs over this picture, despite its breathtaking green field. The woman and child trudging down the road project what must have been Pissarro\u2019s sense that he was abandoning his tiny family as he tended to the needs of his widowed mother in Paris. His formal treatment of this rural landscape, with the dark gloom hanging over the entire scene, was perhaps an unconscious manifestation of his personal burdens and may explain why, as viewers, we feel a sense of urgency and concern for the two lone figures. The top left corner is overwhelmed by a gray mass and the lower right by an ordered and very symmetrical patch of green, a clever formal device that traps the other elements within a diagonal noose and further heightens the sense of suffocation, perhaps an indication of the artist\u2019s own sense of despair, especially in light of his worsening financial situation. Pissarro\u2019s \u201cwinter\u201d is bleaker than the gorgeous, snowy hunter\u2019s winters of Courbet, and the sheer desolation and loneliness of the picture has few equals in French landscape painting of the 1860s. It must have been a bitter farewell to Varenne-Saint-Hilaire, and the decision to move to Pontoise was likely made both to be nearer to the northern Parisian train stations so that the painter could travel more easily between his home and that of his mother\u2019s in the 9th arrondissement, and to increase Pissarro\u2019s proximity to Dr. Gachet, the homeopathic physician who helped her in the year after her husband\u2019s death and who kept a house in nearby Auvers. Pissarro was to have a virtually lifelong relationship with the doctor and homeopathic medicine, and he may well have wanted to be nearer to the healer as his own family grew older. Given his deep connection to the natural world and respect for the landscape, it is understandable that Pissarro turned to Gachet\u2019s homeopathy by the early 1870s, often writing to him and inquiring about organic remedies.\n\nBoth Pissarro\u2019s life and artistic practice display a certain integrity and genuineness that seem the rightful expressions of a humble landscape painter and family man. Banks of the Marne in Winter, in particular, although banal, is still picturesque; as \u00c9mile Zola and Jean Rousseau raved in 1866, it is an honest, simple, and straightforward depiction of nature\u2019s unassuming beauty. The structure of the painting, with its rigorous \u201cside entrance,\u201d places viewers in a peripheral position rather than the central one usual in the construction of fictive landscape spaces. And the almost completely flat plane of green that occupies the remainder of the foreground forms a wall, thereby preventing entrance, rather than the more typical inviting horizontal plane that permits viewers to imagine a rural walk. The sky is rendered with a palette knife which gives the clouds such glowering power that they seem to press on the earth. The architectural elements, also defined with thick slabs of paint rigorously controlled by the palette knife, are just that\u2014elements, representing no more than the basic forms of the building. They resemble barnacles attached to the earth and are portrayed in such a way that viewers sense nature\u2019s dignity and, by extension, Pissarro\u2019s fascination with the rural landscape\u2019s charm. Zola put it best in a review of the artist\u2019s work in a later Salon:\n\nThe originality here is profoundly human. It is not derived from a certain facility of hand or from a falsification of nature. It stems from the temperament of the painter himself and comprises a feeling for truth resulting from an inner conviction. Never before have paintings appeared to me to possess such an overwhelming dignity. One can almost hear the inner voices of the earth and sense the trees burgeoning. The boldness of the horizons, the disdain of any show, the complete lack of cheap tricks, imbue the whole with an indescribable feeling of epic grandeur. Such reality is more than a daydream . . . Camille Pissarro is one of the three or four genuine painters of the day. He has solidity and breadth of touch, he paints freely, following tradition like the old masters. I have rarely encountered a technique that is so sure. A beautiful painting by this man is the act of an honest man. I cannot think of a better way of describing his talent.  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Using a non-standard-size, twill-weave support, Pissarro used wet-in-wet modeling and heavy application of paint with a palette knife to articulate the landscape. X-ray and infrared examination indicate an earlier composition that featured a large group of trees at the upper left, a low horizon line with sweeping clouds occupying almost half of the canvas, and opposing diagonals in the foreground landscape, with the elements at the right mirroring those at the left. The texture of many of these elements can be seen under normal viewing conditions, and evidence of earlier paint layers is visible along the turnover edges. A small figure and falling tree in the left foreground have been painted out as well. Pissarro executed the foreground of the visible composition first with a muted, brown palette before applying deep greens to large portions of the image. The work is currently varnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 2.7).\n\nSigned and dated: C. Pissarro 1866 (lower right, in red and brown paint) (fig. 2.8).\n\nThe work was signed at least twice in the same location, first with a bright red. Once that was dry, the artist reinforced his signature in brown-black. A third application of dark, muted green above and into the brown-black may have served to further subdue the underlying red (fig. 2.9).\n\nFlax, commonly known as linen (estimated).\n\nThe original size of the canvas is unclear, as the tacking margins were removed in a previous treatment, but it appears to be close to its current dimensions (90.6 \u00d7 150.2 cm). This appears to be a non-standard size.\n\n3/2 twill weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 27.1V (0.6) \u00d7 19.6H (1.4) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThere is strong cusping on all four sides corresponding to original tack placement. Thread thickness varies greatly in the warp threads while thread count and density vary greatly in the weft. The weft thread count diagram indicates there are three bands of weft density: the upper third is woven rather tightly, while the middle third is slightly looser and the lower third, loosest (fig. 2.10).\n\nCurrent stretching: The work is currently lined (see Conservation History); its original tacking margins have been removed and it is stretched and secured by the second lining canvas.\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 5\u20138 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: It is unclear whether the current stretcher is original to the painting; however, its design and patina suggest that, if not original, it was added early in the painting\u2019s life. It is a six-member keyable stretcher with horizontal and vertical half-lap joint crossbars (fig. 2.11). Depth: 2.1 cm.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nIt is unclear whether the ground was applied to the canvas before or after it was stretched, as the tacking margins have been removed (see Conservation History). The ground appears to extend to the edges of the remaining canvas under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 2.12), and the composition of the ground, with only trace amounts of extenders, suggests an artist rather than color merchant application. The preparation is of moderate thickness, ranging from approximately 10 to 85 \u00b5m, and leaves some of the canvas texture visible. In one cross section the ground appears as a two-layered system, with a more densely packed layer over a thicker, possibly more medium-rich layer (fig. 2.13). Without a strong boundary between the layers, this effect may indicate two applications of ground material, wet-into-wet, with differences in medium-to-pigment ratios caused by uneven settling of the ground material during preparation. None of the ground is left visible in the finished composition.\n\nThe ground appears to be soft white, with a slightly gray cast and dark particles visible in both cross-sectional and stereomicroscopic analysis (fig. 2.14).\n\nThe ground is primarily lead white, with a small amount of bone black and traces of natural barite. There are also localized areas with red, iron-containing aluminosilicates; many of these are toward the lower edge of the ground near the interface with the canvas and do not appear to have much bearing on the overall color of the ground. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography or microscopic examination.\n\nIt appears that Pissarro may have started with a composition quite different from the visible painting, carrying some elements from earlier forms into the later arrangement. The X-ray indicates a group of trees at the far left nestled into low hills (fig. 2.15). Curving forms extending from the bottom of the large area of foliage may refer to trunks of another, perhaps unrelated element of either composition. The trees were very thickly painted and may have been partially scraped back before being painted over, but their texture is clearly visible in the upper left quadrant of the painting under normal viewing conditions. Small areas of loss along the turnover edge at left also suggest something of the palette of these trees, featuring many of the same deep greens and browns seen throughout the visible composition (fig. 2.16).\n\nThe earlier composition seen in the X-ray also featured a much lower horizon line, beginning roughly in the middle of the canvas at the left edge, with low hills rolling slightly downward and leveling off toward the right. This early horizon line is largely obscured by the low line of soft, light brown trees or shrubbery extending across the background along the far side of the riverbank. The strongly articulated clouds are seen to take up almost half the canvas in the X-ray, extending all the way to the early horizon line before the higher, sloping hills of the current composition were added. The X-ray also indicates that at some point the first horizon may have sloped slightly upward again at the far right, to the level of the current horizon. The foreground of this earlier composition also featured a more symmetrical arrangement of opposing diagonals moving backward in space toward a more central vanishing point. Here, landscape elements running from the center midground outward toward the lower right almost mirror similar compositional lines at left. Microscopic examination of the right edge reveals light-gray underlayers that may relate to this radio-opaque form, possibly indicating the presence of water or snow (fig. 2.17).\n\nWhile most of this earlier composition was covered by the visible landscape, much of the angry sky, especially on the right, was carried over from the previous work and left visible and relatively untouched. This second landscape seems to have been executed directly over the previous forms while they were still soft, without an interlayer or any painting out. Close examination of the surface also reveals that the current landscape was first painted in reddish-browns and tans, resembling Pissarro\u2019s circa 1866 preparatory sketch (PDRS 106; see curatorial essay). These earlier tones can be seen in more thinly painted areas of the foreground as well as in traction cracks (fig. 2.18). Many of the green tones seen throughout the landscape appear to have been added near the end of the painting process. Cross sections from two different areas of the landscape show warmer, orangey tones beneath the currently visible deep greens and dark browns of the trees and foreground. Interestingly, cross-sectional examination also suggests that the artist adjusted the hills at the far left, and a close look at the X-ray in this area hints that they may have first continued the upward slope all the way to the left edge, much as they do in the painted study (fig. 2.19). A sample taken from the left edge above the current tree line appears to contain a layer of green relating to the clump of trees in the original composition, followed by a layer of bright orange that was likely related to the earlier version of the current composition. The wrinkling seen in this part of the painting\u2014such that the outline of the large group of trees is still somewhat visible under normal viewing conditions\u2014attests that these elements of the first composition were not fully dry, but rather likely still soft when Pissarro changed his vantage point and chose a new site. In UV illumination a thin varnish layer can be seen just above the orange layer in the cross section (fig. 2.20), suggesting that he felt the composition was finished at this point, when it probably closely resembled the sketch, and allowed the paint layers to dry before changing his mind and making further alterations. Above the varnish layer, a brown similar in tone to that of the distant trees along the horizon suggests the artist first changed the palette of the painting before adjusting the tree line and introducing darker storm clouds at the left.\n\nSmaller changes can also be seen in the lower left quadrant, where a single, loosely articulated figure appears to have been painted out of the lower left foreground path (fig. 2.21). Additionally, the infrared image indicates that one of the trees at left was first shown falling toward the left; in the final composition this tree appears upright, even with the rest of the row.\n\nPissarro used stiff-bristle brushes and a palette knife to articulate forms, painting largely wet-in-wet (fig. 2.22, fig. 2.23). As mentioned above (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions), the presence of traction cracking and the wrinkling of the paint also indicate that the artist continued to change the composition and applied additional paint before the underlayers were fully dry (fig. 2.24). Many details in the work, including the figures and the horse, were summarily executed as final details in only a few strokes (fig. 2.25).\n\nWide variety of brush widths and thicknesses with strokes up to 1.5 cm, both soft and stiff bristle; palette knife.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white; zinc white; iron oxide red, yellow, and burnt umber; chrome yellow; cadmium yellow; emerald green; viridian; bone black; cobalt blue; ultramarine blue; and possibly Prussian blue and zinc yellow.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination of cross sections, especially in UV light, suggests the presence of a fluorescing red lake in very small amounts (fig. 2.26).\n\nThe painting features complicated pigment mixtures as well as wet-in-wet modeling and mixing of colors on the painted surface. The olive green associated with the clump of trees in the earlier composition, seen in this cross section (fig. 2.27), contains iron-containing earth pigments including umber, chrome yellow, and a small amount of bone black. The mossy green above it contains the same iron-containing earth colors, with large red and yellow particles visible, in addition to cadmium yellow and lead white. Interestingly, both greens seen in this cross section do not include any green or blue pigments, but utilize a kind of optical green by mixing blacks and browns with yellow. Coarsely ground pigments can be seen clearly under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 2.28).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has remains of a natural-resin varnish throughout, especially in the foreground (fig. 2.29), and has an overall synthetic varnish. The presence of a varnish layer within a cross section (fig. 2.26) suggests that the artist was still varnishing paintings at this early point in his career and likely would have varnished this painting.\n\nThe painting was first examined upon acquisition in 1957, at which point it was noted as double-lined with two canvases and aqueous adhesive. The painting was also noted at that time as having a selectively or partially removed natural-resin varnish with some obvious retouching visible in UV examination, and other retouching visible under stereomicroscopic examination. At that time it was recommended that both linings be removed and that the painting be cleaned and revarnished before travel, but this does not appear to have been undertaken. An examination in 1961 noted scratches at lower center. A 1986 treatment included removal of two synthetic varnishes, including a heavily discolored Lucite varnish, revarnishing with B72, and limited inpainting.\n\nThe painting is currently in good condition, double-lined, planar, and varnished with both B72 and the remainder of the selectively removed natural-resin varnish noted in 1957. This varnish and most retouchings are visible in ultraviolet examination (fig. 2.29). The tacking margins of both the original and first lining canvas have been removed and can be seen where the paper tape covering the edges of the work is missing (fig. 2.30). There is pronounced cracking throughout the work and minor losses to the edges. The painting has much wrinkling and additional traction cracking throughout, likely the result of the artist\u2019s thick painting style and numerous compositional changes. The pressure of the lining process has flattened these wrinkles in several areas of the painting.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1998): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an Italian, nineteenth-century, Neoclassical frame with a cavetto section and waterleaf-and-dart ornament with lamb\u2019s-tongue sight molding. The frame has water gilding over yellow bole overall, with orange-brown bole on the fillets, on gesso. The gilding is highly burnished on the upper rail fillet and on the fillet adjacent to and under the lamb\u2019s-tongue molding; the remaining surfaces are very lightly rubbed. The applewood frame consists of a side-and-face molding mitered and applied to a tenoned cassetta. The waterleaf-and-dart molding and the lamb\u2019s-tongue molding are carved linden; they were gilded off the frame before being mitered and applied. The frame was resized for this painting; the cassetta construction was altered by removing the outer leg of the tenon and replacing it with triangular jelutong gussets. The upper horizontal cassetta leg was also repaired with jelutong. The cable ou cordage ornament is centered and carved directly on the molding. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is scotia side; fillet; cavetto; fillet; torus with carved and applied waterleaf-and-dart ornament; ovolo; fillet; cavetto; fillet; ogee with carved and applied lamb\u2019s-tongue ornament; fillet; ovolo with cable ou cordage ornament; and fillet with a cove sight edge (fig. 2.31).\n\nPrevious frame (removed 1998): The work was previously housed in an English, eighteenth-century Georgian Louis XIV, straight-sided ogee frame with scrolling foliate and strap ornament and acanthus leaves at the miters, altered with a later addition of a fillet and cove liner. The frame had water gilding, with oil gilding on the sanded frieze, over thin yellow-brown bole on gesso. The ornament on the ogee face was burnished. The outer carved molding retained its original gilding, but it was in poor condition. The edge of the leaf ornament on the sight molding was partially regilded when the later fillet and cove sight molding were added, and the reworked areas were retoned. The carved pine moldings were mitered and joined with angled, sliding, dovetailed splines. The original moldings were altered twice to adapt the frame for different paintings. During the first alteration, the frame was resized and the liner element added, then everything was glued to a back frame. To adapt the frame for this painting, the frame was cut in the middle of each molding, butt-jointed, and glued to a secondary back frame. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was scotia; fillet; ovolo with half-patera; hollow side; ogee face with scrolling foliate and strap ornament on a plain ground and acanthus leaves at the miters; sanded frieze; ogee with leaf-tip ornament; and a later addition of a fillet and cove sight molding (fig. 2.32).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">By descent from the artist (died 1903) to his son, Paul-\u00c9mile Pissarro, Paris, 1904.\n\nSold at the Pissarro sale, Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, Dec. 3, 1928, lot 27, to Jacques Dubourg, Paris, for 35,100 francs.\n\nAcquired by S.-G.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that was given to the painting when it was exhibited at the Salon of 1866. The painting had the following title during the lifetime of the artist:\n\nMay 1, 1866: Bords de la Marne en hiver (Explication des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, architecture, gravure et lithographie, exh. cat. [Charles de Mourgues Fr\u00e8res, 1866], p. 199, cat. 1564.)\n\nAlthough Pissarro first signed the painting in a brilliant red, he later re-signed the work in a more muted brown, presumably after the Salon. Pissarro participated in the Salons of 1859, 1864\u201365, and 1867\u201370.\n\nOn Daubigny\u2019s influence on Pissarro, see Kermit Swiler Champa, Studies in Early Impressionism (Yale University Press, 1973), pp. 70\u201371. See also PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 118, 121, on Daubigny\u2019s role on the Salon jury and lobbying for the acceptance of Pissarro\u2019s works to both the 1865 and 1866 Salons.\n\nThe small oil-on-canvas painting (21.6 \u00d7 27.3 cm [8 1/2 \u00d7 10 3/4 in.]) is signed C. Pizarro. at lower left.\n\nI propose the following on the basis of size, signatures, and inscriptions. The work labeled simply Paysage may be PDRS 74: La Varenne-Saint-Hilaire, vue de Champigny (c. 1863; Sz\u00e9pm\u00fcv\u00e9szeti Museum, Budapest). This same work is also PV 31, where it is identified by the same title but undated. The work simply called \u00c9tude is PDRS 55: Promenade sur un chemin (1862; private collection, United States). It is not listed in PV. The painting designated Village is PDRS 70, Coin du village, femmes causant (1863; formerly in a private collection, the Netherlands, then sold at Sotheby\u2019s, New York, Nov. 6, 2002). It is also listed as PV 27, where it is dated 1863.\n\nSee Kermit Swiler Champa, Studies in Early Impressionism (Yale University Press, 1973), pp. 67\u201379, esp. p. 70. Champa describes Pissarro\u2019s large Salon landscapes as \u201cmore forceful than anything he had accomplished to date.\u201d To most historians of modern art, Pissarro\u2019s large-scale Salon landscape paintings of the 1860s constitute the apogee of his career. Even Paul C\u00e9zanne, his most brilliantly successful \u201cstudent\u201d (Pissarro would have shuddered at the term), is reported to have said, \u201cIf Pissarro had continued to paint as he did in 1870, he would be greater than all of us today.\u201d See Joachim Pissarro, \u201cA Backward Glance,\u201d in Pioneering Modern Painting: C\u00e9zanne and Pissarro, 1865\u20131885 (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2006), pp. 187, 223, n. 2. Yet, although the paintings were praised by contemporary critics, often studied in the twentieth century, and are well known to scholars, none sold in the artist\u2019s lifetime, nor have they won great popular fame compared to the artist\u2019s peasant pictures and urban landscapes, such as the Art Institute\u2019s Young Peasant Girl Having Her Coffee (cat. 10) and Place du Havre (cat. 13).\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 115, 118. The couple\u2019s first child, Lucien, was born in February 1863 at 23, rue Neuve-Br\u00e9da in Paris. The couple\u2019s second child, a girl named Jeanne-Rachel, was born in May 1865 in La Varenne-Saint-Hilaire.\n\nFor Pissarro\u2019s Salon entries, including this painting, see Kermit Swiler Champa, Studies in Early Impressionism (Yale University Press, 1973), pp. 67\u201379. For Pissarro\u2019s Pontoise years see Richard R. Brettell, Pissarro and Pontoise (Yale University Press, 1990). For Pissarro\u2019s early years (1855\u201369), praise of his early landscapes, and Salon activity, see Joachim Pissarro, Camille Pissarro (Abrams, 1993), pp. 38\u201357. For family moves in the 1860s and the representation of the associated regions in Pissarro\u2019s works, see PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 111\u201326; and vol. 2, pp. 65\u2013128. For additional information on Pissarro\u2019s early family life, see Richard R. Brettell, Pissarro\u2019s People (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco/Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute/Prestel, 2011), pp. 19\u201321, 24, 26\u201328, 30\u201331, 83\u2013102.\n\nInterestingly, in each year, two works were accepted by the Salon, only one of which has been positively identified in the literature. These have been discussed with formal rigor by Kermit Champa in his superb study of early Impressionism. See Kermit Swiler Champa, Studies in Early Impressionism (Yale University Press, 1973), pp. 70\u201371, fig. 99. For this 1864 Salon entry (PDRS 90), see also PDRS, vol. 2, p. 86. For Pissarro\u2019s study for his 1864 Salon entry Banks of the Marne, see Champa, fig. 100, and PDRS 89.\n\nCompare, for example, Courbet\u2019s The Brook of Les Puits-Noir (c. 1855; Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nFor the exhibition of Road to Cachalas at La Roche-Guyon at the 1864 Salon, see PDRS, vol. 1, p. 116. The only mention of Pissarro\u2019s Road to Cachalas at La Roche-Guyon I was able to locate is in Cadart and Luquet, eds., L\u2019union des arts: Nouvelles des beaux-arts, des lettres et des th\u00e9\u00e2tres, no. 22 (June 25, 1864), under the section \u201cPetite chronique.\u201d It was mentioned along with Banks of the Marne. Under the section \u201cSalon de 1864,\u201d in L\u2019union des arts, no. 25 (July 16, 1864), only Pissarro\u2019s Banks of the Marne is briefly discussed. This information suggests that the second work that Pissarro exhibited at the 1864 Salon along with Banks of the Marne (PDRS 90) was a work entitled Road to Cachalas. In the issues of L\u2019union des arts listed above, Pissarro\u2019s two Salon submissions are listed together. This implies that they were both paintings, as there was a separate section at the Salon at this time for works on paper and the graphic arts. For Pissarro\u2019s search for motifs in various rural settings, including La Roche-Guyon, see Christopher Lloyd, Camille Pissarro (Rizzoli, 1981), p. 28.\n\nOn Daubigny\u2019s influence on Pissarro, see Kermit Swiler Champa, Studies in Early Impressionism (Yale University Press, 1973), pp. 70\u201371. See also PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 118, 121, on Daubigny\u2019s role on the Salon jury and lobbying for the acceptance of Pissarro\u2019s works in both the 1865 and 1866 Salons.\n\nAccording to Joachim Pissarro, Rachel Pissarro\u2019s opposition to her son\u2019s relationship with Julie Vellay was based more on her economic and social background than her religion, because she was not at all a practicing Christian. See also PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 111\u201313. Julie had been hired as the Pissarros\u2019 kitchen maid in 1860, and soon after she and Camille began an affair. According to PDRS, vol. 1, p. 113, Pissarro\u2019s parents preferred that he wed a Jewish girl from a respectable and prosperous family, but the artist continued his relationship with Julie despite their disapproval.\n\nFor the Pissarros\u2019 financial situation in 1863\u201366, see PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 115\u201321. In a letter to Julie dated August 31, 1866, Pissarro complained that if his mother did not assist him financially, he would find himself in a very difficult position. Joachim Pissarro also states that Camille\u2019s father grudgingly agreed to finance his career as an artist only if he attended a proper art school such as the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. His mother continued to give her son a modest allowance until he was well into his forties.\n\nSee PDRS 89, 90, vol. 2, p. 86. For Pissarro\u2019s submission of Banks of the Marne to the 1864 Salon, see PDRS, vol. 1, p. 116. Just as he had done for his 1864 Salon submission, Pissarro made a study for his 1866 Salon submission, Bords de la Marne en hiver. See PDRS, vol. 2, p. 95, cats. 106\u201307 (ill.).\n\nThis \u201cautumn effect\u201d creates an aura through the use of color, predominantly browns and other earth tones. See Kermit Swiler Champa, Studies in Early Impressionism (Yale University Press, 1973), pp. 74\u201379, for a discussion of Pissarro\u2019s unique creation of atmospheric effects in his paintings, and \u201cthe making of expressive equivalents of nature in painted color.\u201d In the next decade this creation of \u201ceffects\u201d would become the express goal of Impressionist plein air painting through the capturing of light\u2019s impressions on the natural environment via the juxtaposition of colors on canvas\u2014an aim and an approach that seem to have been on Pissarro\u2019s mind as early as the mid-1860s.\n\nAccording to Joachim Pissarro, very few things can be characterized clearly or definitively in this part of Pissarro\u2019s life. Joachim Pissarro, personal communication, Nov. 2014. The move from Varenne to Pontoise may have stemmed from to a lease that came due, or perhaps the artist had previously negotiated its terms to end in the early spring. It is also possible that the opening of the new railway station prompted his move to Pontoise, because the increased access to Paris would help further his career.\n\nFor the full transcribed letter, see Camille Pissarro to Francisco Oller, Paris, December 14, 1865, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 533\u201334, n. 8. Although Pissarro stated in the letter to Oller that he would be living in Varenne-Saint-Hilaire until April of the following year, the letter was written from the Batignolles district in Paris\u2019s 17th arrondissement, where his friend Guillemet resided at the time. For Guillemet\u2019s residence at 20, grande rue des Batignolles, see PDRS, vol. 1, p. 121. For Oller\u2019s ownership of some of Pissarro\u2019s older works, see Camille Pissarro to Duret, Pontoise, May 5, 1874, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 1, 1865\u20131885 (Presses Universitaires de France, 1980), pp. 93\u201394, n. 2. According to PDRS, vol. 1, p. 121, Pissarro may have been drawn to Pontoise because he had previously worked in nearby Montmorency and found it attractive; he remarked a few years later that he considered the region very beautiful, perhaps because of the rural landscapes along the banks of the Oise. Moreover, according to Pissarro and Durand-Ruel Snollaerts, the opening of a railway station in 1862 facilitated travel to Paris, which would have appealed to Pissarro as he often commuted between the country and the city as his career progressed, likely to stay in close touch with the artistic community, dealers, and potential buyers. See PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 119\u201322, for Pissarro\u2019s relationship with Oller. For more on Oller, his political affiliations, art, and short-lived relationship with Pissarro, see also Nicholas Mirzoeff, The Right to Look: A Counterhistory of Visuality (Duke University Press, 2011), pp. 172\u201395, 329.\n\nPDRS, vol. 1, pp. 120\u201321. See also Camille Pissarro to Francisco Oller, Paris, December 14, 1865, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u201394 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 533\u201334. In his letter to Oller dated December 14, 1865, Pissarro described Guillemet\u2019s projects, commenting, \u201cIl est en train de faire des natures mortes et des fleurs\u201d (He\u2019s making still lifes and flowers), suggesting that the artist spent enough time there to witness his friend\u2019s new painting endeavors. In the same letter, Pissarro also told Oller that he could send his replies to Guillemet\u2019s, which further suggests that the artist was spending a lot of time in his friend\u2019s Batignolles studio.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 120\u201322, and vol. 2, pp. 95\u2013101. In the section on Pontoise in volume two, there can be seen a surge of green in Pissarro\u2019s landscapes, much like in the painting he exhibited at the 1866 Salon, Banks of the Marne in Winter. On the structured yet intimate nature of Pissarro\u2019s Pontoise landscapes, see Richard R. Brettell, Pissarro\u2019s People (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco/Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute/Prestel, 2011), pp. 19\u201323. For a detailed analysis of Pissarro\u2019s Pontoise periods, see Richard R. Brettell, Pissarro and Pontoise (Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 1\u20135, 37\u201371, 101\u201308, 124\u201330, 145\u201360. Analysis suggests the green grass is a complicated mixture based on viridian, with small amounts of several pigments including cadmium yellow, cobalt blue, lead white, iron-oxide earth pigments, burnt umber, and bone black. For more on the work\u2019s palette, see Palette in the technical report.\n\nFor the Pissarros\u2019 financial situation in 1863\u201366, see PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 115\u201321. In a letter to Julie dated August 31, 1866, Pissarro complained that if his mother did not assist him financially, he would find himself in a very difficult position. Joachim Pissarro also states that Camille\u2019s father grudgingly accepted to finance his career as an artist only if he attended a proper art school such as the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. His mother continued to give her son a modest allowance until he was well into his forties.\n\nFor the intimate relationship between Dr. Gachet and some of the Impressionists, including Vincent van Gogh, as well as information on the physician\u2019s house in Auvers, see Joachim Pissarro, Pioneering Modern Painting: C\u00e9zanne and Pissarro, 1865\u20131885 (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2006), pp. 123\u201343. C\u00e9zanne painted the physician\u2019s house in Auvers, an area where both he and Pissarro gathered in the early 1870s to depict the Auvers-sur-Oise landscape. For artists' correspondence with Dr. Gachet and their professional as well as creative relationships (most notably that between Dr. Gachet and Van Gogh, who was treated by the doctor two months before he died), see Paul Gachet, Lettres impressionnistes au Dr. Gachet et \u00e0 Murer (B. Grasset, 1957). See also Paul Gachet, Deux amis des impressionnistes: Le docteur Gachet et Murer (\u00c9ds. des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, 1956). For additional chronology of Dr. Gachet\u2019s relationships with the Impressionists, see Roger Golb\u00e9ry, Mon oncle, Paul Gachet (Valhermeil, 1990).\n\nPDRS, vol. 2, p. 96.\n\nFor Zola\u2019s 1868 Salon criticism of Pissarro\u2019s three works portraying L\u2019Hermitage at Pontoise, see Christopher Lloyd, Camille Pissarro (Rizzoli, 1981), pp. 32\u201335.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the lower (first) signature is a mixture containing predominantly iron oxide red and chrome or zinc yellow, with mixtures featering burnt umber, emerald green, and black on top of it. The presence of iron, zinc, and copper was confirmed with XRF. See Marc Vermeulen, \u201cPsro\\_57\\_306\\_XRF,\u201d Sept. 11, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDue to the absence of tacking margins (see Conservation History), the canvas was not analyzed. The estimation of linen is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique. All canvas paintings by Pissarro that were analyzed as part of this study were found to have a linen support.\n\nInterestingly, The Hermitage at Pontoise (1867; Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne) is roughly the same size (91.0 \u00d7 150.5 cm), suggesting that this non-standard choice was deliberate. The paintings also have the same stretcher construction, the same style of handwriting in verso inscriptions located in approximately the same spot on the stretcher, and the same fabric weave (both are twill, although The Hermitage at Pontoise is specifically herringbone). See \u201cBrief Report on Technology and Condition: Camille Pissarro, L\u2019Hermitag [sic] near Pontoise,\u201d in Research Project Painting Techniques of Impressionism and Postimpressionism, online catalogue: http://www.museenkoeln.de/ausstellungen/wrm\\_0802\\_impressionismus/03\\_abbzoom.asp?lang=en&amp;pg=&amp;typ=kuenstler&amp;val=19&amp;iid=32.\n\nThe closest standard size is a seascape (marine) 80, which measures 146 \u00d7 89 cm. See the chart of standard sizes available from Lefranc &amp; Company, c. 1863, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 45, fig. 30.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Camille Pissarro, The Banks of the Marne in Winter, 1866 (PS107/1957.306),\u201d Aug. 2012.\n\nPissarro\u2019s The Hermitage at Pontoise (1867; Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne) from the following year is roughly the same size (91.0 \u00d7 150.5 cm), shares the same stretcher construction, the same style of handwriting in verso inscriptions located in approximately the same spot on the stretcher, and the same fabric weave (both are twill, although The Hermitage at Pontoise is specifically herringbone). See \u201cBrief Report on Technology and Condition: Camille Pissarro L\u2019Hermitag [sic] near Pontoise,\u201d in Research Project Painting Techniques of Impressionism and Postimpresionism, online catalogue: http://www.museenkoeln.de/ausstellungen/wrm\\_0802\\_impressionismus/03\\_abbzoom.asp?lang=en&amp;pg=&amp;typ=kuenstler&amp;val=19&amp;iid=32.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including a glue lining. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_BanksMarne\\_1957\\_306\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 11, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis is the approximate ground thickness in samples examined by SEM/EDX. The ground may have different thicknesses in areas that were not sampled. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_BanksMarne\\_1957\\_306\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 11, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM-EDX and XRF. The presence of lead was confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also detected barite, aluminosilicates, iron, and bone black. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_BanksMarne\\_1957\\_306\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 11, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 3.\n\nMary Sebera previously identified this group of trees as one large tree, probably in the foreground. The absence of a trunk, in addition to the presence of a similar motif in Banks of the Marne (1864; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum; 81.9 \u00d7 107.9 cm), among others, has led to the current interpretation. See Mary Sebera, \u201cTechnical Notes,\u201d in Pissarro: Creating the Impressionist Landscape, ed. Katherine Rothkopf, exh. cat. (Baltimore Museum of Art, 2007), n.p.\n\nBanks of the Marne (1864; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum; 81.9 \u00d7 107.9 cm) features, in addition to the group of trees at left, the river at the lower right.\n\nThe related study for this painting (see fig. 2.6 in the curatorial report) is more square and depicts less of the landscape, ending just before the river would be visible, and the tree line in the background levels off at the left.\n\nThis form was previously interpreted as a cow in a vertical landscape. See Mary Sebera, \u201cTechnical Notes,\u201d in Pissarro: Creating the Impressionist Landscape, ed. Katherine Rothkopf, exh. cat. (Baltimore Museum of Art, 2007), n.p.\n\nThe following pigments were identified using the following methods indicated: lead white; zinc white; iron oxide red, yellow, and umber; cadmium yellow; viridian; bone black; cobalt blue; and possible Prussian blue (XRF, SEM/EDX); chrome yellow, ultramarine blue (SEM/EDX); possible zinc yellow (XRF). For more detailed results and information on the conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_BanksMarne\\_1957\\_306\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 11, 2014; and Marc Vermeulen, \u201cPsro\\_57\\_306\\_XRF,\u201d Sept. 11, 2012; both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its autofluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors (including the type of mordant, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments) can affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lake, including its fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed.

The seemingly quick modification of an English frame seems an unlikely solution for a French framer.
