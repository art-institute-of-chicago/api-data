    "web_url": "https://www.artic.edu/collection/resources/educator-resources/17-educator-resource-packet-city-landscape-by-joan-mitchell",
    "copy": " During the early 1950s, the decade in which City Landscape was produced, Joan Mitchell created many paintings that suggest urban environments. With its pulsating strands and slashes of bright color, the work evokes memories of bustling cities that Mitchell recalled from her travels in the American Midwest. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
