    "copy": " Part of the reason that the Modern Wing feels so harmonious is because, well, it is. And the secret behind that lies in one measurement: 6 \u00be\", aka the width of the oak floorboards in the Modern Wing. That\u2019s right\u2014everything in the building is based around that one tiny measurement. Of course, not everything in the building is 6 \u00be\", but everything is a multiple of that number. To lay it out for you: 6 \u00be\" x 2 = 1'1 \u00bd\" 6 \u00be\" x 4 = 2'3\" 6 \u00be\" x 8 = 4'6\" 6 \u00be\" x 16 = 9' 6 \u00be\" x 32 = 18' Not that I don\u2019t trust the Renzo Piano Building Workshop, but I decided to test this for myself . . . photographic evidence is below.   And it\u2019s not just the architecture that follows these rules.   Finally, I headed into the galleries and you guessed it . . . even this sculpture stand is 2'3\" wide. Also, for our loyal readers, please note the \"reveal\" at the bottom, previously discussed here by Erin H.   As you can tell, everything was just as precise as I expected. So the next time you enter the Modern Wing and wonder why you feel so peaceful, remember it\u2019s all in the math. \u2014Katie Rahn ",
