    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR Nell Gwyn was a favorite mistress of England\u2019s King Charles II and bore him two children. But she grew up in humble circumstances.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS She sold fruit. She  eventually became an actress.  It was because women were allowed to appear on stage at all in the later part of the 17th century, that Nell gained favor at court.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR When King Charles saw her perform, he was immediately smitten and eventually took her as a lover.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS She lived in a time when it was fairly new to have social mobility. And it\u2019s likely for that reason that her biography became so fascinating to so many people. Even today, there\u2019s a Broadway play based on her life.</p>\n<p>And unlike a single painted portrait that might have been made for Charles II to remember his favorite mistress when she couldn\u2019t be with him, a portrait print could be printed in multiples and circulated. The idea that someone\u2019s mistress could be the subject for a work of art that would find a mass audience was entirely new.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s sort of a version of People magazine, you could imagine.  This was a kind of early idea of celebrity.</p>\n<p>Her likeness was something that people wanted to possess. And this particular impression was printed on blue paper, which made the object even more appealing as something to touch and to behold.</p>\n",
