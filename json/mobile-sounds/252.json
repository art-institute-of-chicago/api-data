    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: A number of Van Dyck\u2019s portrait prints circulated during his lifetime, but when he died at the age of 42, the series as a whole had not yet been published. The first complete edition appeared four years later, in 1645. This image by Jacob Van Neeffs was the title page. It was based on a Van Dyck self-portrait, but the artist took a few liberties, following the publisher\u2019s directives.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: Neeffs recast the image to create a tongue-in-cheek reference to the art of portraiture, as if Van Dyck has been transformed into a Roman emperor whose sculpted bust is placed on a pedestal, quite literally.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Written on the pedestal is the title page information.</p>\n<p>Next to this print you\u2019ll see a drawing that copies the title page.  It includes a note about the portrait series in Italian, likely indicating it had wide international distribution.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: There are subsequent editions of this series later in the 17th Century, again in the 18th Century. And the successive editions of these prints really reflect the ongoing widespread appetite for the portraits that Van Dyck made, and for the experience of seeing them and handling them as a collective work of art.</p>\n",
