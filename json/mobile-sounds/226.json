    "transcript": "<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS:  Portrait prints had been made since the beginning of the history of the print.  But they typically were used to represent political figures or scholars.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Until Van Dyck\u2019 created the Iconography. In this series of prints he not only included political leaders and other renowned citizens, but artists as well, signaling their growing importance in 17th century European society. The Art Institute is fortunate to own all of Van Dyck\u2019s etchings for this project, and they are exhibited here for the first time in almost a century.</p>\n<p>The artist began the series by casually creating 15 portraits, expecting that expert printmakers would finish his plates. He could hardly have anticipated the interest these \u2018unfinished\u2019 prints would generate.</p>\n<p>In this portrait of artist Justus Sustermans, Van Dyck paid great attention to detail in his sitter\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: And then from there, the description of the sitter becomes increasingly abstract. And we eventually get to the painter\u2019s right hand, which is drawn in with just the most preliminary and rudimentary lines, sort of square-shaped fingertips, and no shading whatsoever.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: This contrast between detailed depiction and imaginative abstraction is precisely what caught a collector\u2019s eye and what still seems so modern about Van Dyck\u2019s etchings today. Van Dyck\u2019s self-portrait is probably the first unfinished print ever to have been produced in an edition.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: Like most of the etchings that Van Dyck made, this print shows the effects of an imperfectly polished copper plate. So we see scratches, particularly in the upper register. There\u2019s various other passages where a more conscientious printmaker would have taken pains to remove blemishes or imperfections. But these seemed not to bother Van Dyck very much, nor did it bother some of the early collectors.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Those collectors immediately embraced van Dyck\u2019s revolutionary portraiture, eagerly purchasing new prints for their collections. Nearby, you\u2019ll see other unfinished portraits van Dyck created for the series.</p>\n",
