    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR This is one of the most enduring images in the history of printmaking. Here Albrecht D\u00fcrer depicts Erasmus, the prolific 16th century scholar, humanist, and author of nearly 150 books. It is one of D\u00fcrer\u2019s largest engravings of any subject and a remarkable size for a portrait print.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS He\u2019s not willing to make an entirely conventional portrait print. So we have text elements incorporated in the form of printed books, and an actual text plaque that stands at the back of the scene.</p>\n<p>D\u00fcrer has described Erasmus in the act of writing. In some ways, this portrait print is also a celebration of the power of printmaking, and that is not just the printed image, but also the printed word.</p>\n<p>The face of Erasmus is not at all in the center of the composition. What appears at the center are the scholar\u2019s hands in the act of writing, and close by we see two letters, and those letters, A D, make up the monogram of the artist, Albrecht D\u00fcrer. So, in some way, D\u00fcrer has contrived to place himself at the center of the composition.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR D\u00fcrer\u2019s basic subject matter, however, is entirely conventional. People were curious about how Erasmus looked; his writings had made him famous. In fact, both D\u00fcrer and Erasmus became famous largely through the circulation of their printed work.</p>\n",
