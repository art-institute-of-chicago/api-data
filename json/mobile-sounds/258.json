    "transcript": "<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS By the time we get to the 19th Century, someone like F\u00e9lix Bracquemond is interested in demonstrating what etching could do that could not be done, for example, with a photograph.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR Here he shows Edmond de Goncourt, who, like his brother Jules, was a prominent writer, connoisseur and art collector. Bracquemond had already portrayed the brothers together.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS In this portrait, Bracquemond chooses to show Edmond by himself. He is looking directly out of the composition, engaging with the viewer, and a plume of smoke emerges from the cigarette burning in his right hand.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR The relief sculpture at the upper left and the Japanese metalwork piece below were part of Edmond\u2019s personal collection.</p>\n<p>This is the first of several different states of the portrait that preserve and document Bracquemond\u2019s creative process. In later states, the lower section would become more detailed, and include a book, among other elements.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS But what we see here, harkens back to Van Dyck\u2019s emphasis on the face and hands of his sitters. These two components, it was said of Van Dyck, were all that he needed to portray someone. And so Bracquemond, too, is isolating these physical elements of his subject and chose to print at least 20 impressions of this state before going on to realize the composition further.<br>[word count: 226]</p>\n",
