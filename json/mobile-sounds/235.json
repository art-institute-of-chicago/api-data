    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Hello and welcome to Van Dyck, Rembrandt and the Portrait Print.<br>We begin the tour with this portrait print by Anthony Van Dyck from the early 1630s. Known primarily as a painter of royal subjects, here Van Dyck used etching to create a compelling and radical self-portrait that\u2019s both a touchstone in the history of portraiture and in the history of printmaking. Victoria Sancho Lobis is the Prince Trust Associate Curator in the Department of Prints and Drawings here at the Art Institute and the curator of this exhibition.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: Van Dyck made a revolutionary decision to create this portrait in a completely abbreviated, fragmentary state, to place the image of his face at the very upper register of the etching. And that creates this very dramatic contrast of a highly finished description of the face with this completely unprinted area of the paper below it.</p>\n<p>Artists, before Van Dyck might have shown themselves at work, holding an etching needle or holding a paint brush.  In this case we see Van Dyck looking over his shoulder.  In a moment of distraction he casts a glance over his right shoulder to give a modest bit of attention to someone who may be observing him.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: With works like this one, Van Dyck transformed expectations about what a portrait print could be, and, as you\u2019ll see today, he would influence contemporaries like Rembrandt and generations of artists who followed him. Enjoy your tour.</p>\n",
