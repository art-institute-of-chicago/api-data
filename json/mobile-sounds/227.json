    "transcript": "<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS We\u2019re looking at Rembrandt\u2019s self-portrait, Etching at a Window from 1648, which is one of the real landmarks in his profound body of self-portraits.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR Rembrandt famously portrayed himself in fanciful costumes, with dramatic gestures and expressions. But in this restrained image, he presents himself at work, holding an etching needle in his hand.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS We believe that he would have made this print while looking at himself in a mirror.  And we\u2019re not able to see what he\u2019s drawing on that etching plate. There\u2019s an interesting self-referential element in this print wherehe is in the process of creating a print, perhaps much like the one that we\u2019re looking at.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR In etching, the artist draws an image onto a metal plate before printing. One of the most fascinating aspects of printmaking is that we can trace the artist\u2019s creative process in the different \u2018states,\u2019 or versions, of the image.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS An artist can etch on a copper plate, print that plate, and then decide to change his or her mind and revise the composition.</p>\n<p>This is the first state of the print. And in this first state, we see the open window just as a pure light source. And the viewer is left to imagine what may be beyond the space that the artist occupies. In a way, we can think of this use of the blank paper as a metaphor for inspiration. In later states the open window becomes filled in with a landscape.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR Modest but intimate, this particular impression of the image is among the most beautiful examples of this print.</p>\n",
