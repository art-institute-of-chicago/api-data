    "transcript": "<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: This small format portrait print is a representation of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who is widely known as a courtier in the court of Elizabeth I.  He was known as her favorite, and he was the only real suitor she ever considered.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Hendrick Goltzius, the artist, created this portrait when Dudley was 86.  Dudley may have commissioned it himself, or it may commemorate his appointment as Governor General.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: But what\u2019s especially interesting about it, is that it was printed from a gold plate.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Typical 16th century engravings were printed from copper.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: But Goltzius is known to have made a whole group of portraits using precious metal plates. And by doing this, he effectively created two different works of art simultaneously.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: After prints were pulled from the precious metal plate, it was used as an engraved portrait medallion. Because gold is soft, few impressions could be made. A lettering specialist inscribed Dudley\u2019s name, age and titles to read correctly on the medallion. That\u2019s why they\u2019re reversed in the print.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: In this gallery, we\u2019re able to consider how portrait prints can invite intimacy. And a work of art produced in this small scale really requires the viewer to examine it closely. This is an object that would fit in the palm of one\u2019s hand, much like a cast bronze portrait medallion, or like a painted portrait miniature, all of which are on display nearby.</p>\n",
