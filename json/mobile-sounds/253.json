    "transcript": "<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS Isabella Clara Eugenia was the Spanish regent in the Southern Netherlands. She was the daughter of Philip II of Spain, and married her cousin, Archduke Albert. And they ruled together for decades. He died in 1621, and she decided to adopt a nun\u2019s habit.  And that\u2019s how we see her here.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR The printmaker Paulus Pontius created this print after a painting by Peter Paul Rubens, of the same subject.   One of printmaking\u2019s distinct advantages was its ability to clearly convey information a painting could not.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS It\u2019s painting plus more -- painting and poetry, painting and propaganda.  So we see a painting surrounded by allegorical symbols with a swag of fabric held up by two putti who hold a crown of oak leaves, above which we see the all-seeing eye of Providence radiating light over the whole ensemble.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR A print like this could also be easily reproduced and circulated.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS So that the portrait painting is now converted into an object of political agency promoting this new appearance of Isabella Clara Eugenia as a ruler who has divine inspiration.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: With the framing embellishment, a collector didn\u2019t even need to frame this print\u2013 it could just be mounted directly onto a surface, such as a panel or a placard.</p>\n",
