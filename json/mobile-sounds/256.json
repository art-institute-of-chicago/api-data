    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This is Jan Cornelis Sylvius, a minister in the Dutch Reform Church. A cousin of Rembrandt\u2019s first wife Saskia, Sylvius baptized Rembrandt\u2019s first two children. But he was best known for his considerable skills as an orator.</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: In fact, Rembrandt created this portrait print of Sylvius depicting him in the act of speaking. So, Rembrandt was in some ways confronting the idea of how do you convey speech? Rembrandt has chosen to show him extending his right hand.  This is a classic rhetorical gesture that dates back to ancient sculpture. You can see that his hand casts a shadow on what appears to be the portrait\u2019s frame, and his face also casts a shadow just beyond the darkened oval.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: These devices refer to a tradition of funerary sculpture in the Netherlands, which often included sculpted busts of the deceased emerging from the face of a tomb.  And this is, indeed, a posthumous portrait, produced six years after Sylvius\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>The text around the minister names him, says where he worked, and gives the date of his death. Rembrandt also includes a poem that reads, in part:</p>\n<p>VICTORIA SANCHO LOBIS: \u201cHis eloquence taught men to honor Christ and showed them the true way to heaven.\u201d</p>\n",
