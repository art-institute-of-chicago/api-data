Part human and part horse, silenoi were untamed woodland spirits who engaged in various hedonistic pursuits, namely dancing, cavorting, and overindulging in wine. These busts originally decorated a type of couch on which elite, well-to-do Romans reclined at lavish banquets, reinforcing the message of merriment in the name of Dionysos.   This statue of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, sexuality, and fertility, was inspired by a famed, earlier sculpture known today as the Aphrodite of Knidos. Carved in the mid-fourth century BCE by the sculptor Praxiteles, the original statue, which served as a devotional image in a temple or shrine, was acclaimed for its innovative representation of the goddess in full nudity. In the Roman world, the statuary type was popularly displayed in civic, domestic, and funerary contexts, but it held particular resonance in the private garden. Here the goddess\u2019s voluptuous form and associations with fertility were equated with the growth of vegetation and the pleasure of the garden.   Roman artists were masters at adapting Greek imagery for entirely new functions and contexts. This image of a wounded Greek warrior was created around 447\u2013438 BCE in Athens, where it first appeared as part of a mythical battle scene of Greek soldiers and the legendary Amazon female warriors. This scene decorated the shield of the monumental gold-and-ivory cult statue of the goddess Athena located in the Parthenon. Roughly five to six centuries later, the same figure was adapted from its original religious setting for use on this Roman architectural relief, which likely adorned a major public building or a lavish home.   This intricate cameo, expertly carved from a piece of sardonyx, a type of banded hardstone, combines a portrait of Emperor Claudius (reigned 41\u201354 CE) with the idealized, partially nude body of the supreme deity Jupiter (the Greek\u2019s Zeus). Here the emperor holds the god\u2019s scepter and thunderbolt, while an eagle, Jupiter\u2019s companion animal, stands at his feet. Created for circulation among members of the imperial court, the cameo boldly equated Claudius\u2019s power over the Roman Empire to that of Jupiter over the entire cosmos.   Previous Roman emperors were clean-shaven, but Hadrian (reigned 117\u201338 CE) wore a beard, perhaps to signify his admiration of all things Greek. Earlier Greek intellectuals, particularly those of the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, had worn long, full beards; Hadrian\u2019s neatly trimmed facial hair reflects a more fashionable style worn by Greek men of his day. In this portrait, which originally belonged to a full-length statue or bust, the sculptor created a striking textural contrast between the emperor\u2019s closely cropped facial hair and the thick, luxurious curls of his coiffure, which are undercut to sharply stand out from his forehead.   Roman portraits were created in a variety of media, but painted works rarely survive due to their delicate materials. One noteworthy exception is a group of naturalistic portraits produced in Roman-ruled Egypt for use in mummification. Typically painted on thin wooden boards using pigments mixed with beeswax, such portraits were placed over the deceased\u2019s face and secured with linen wrappings. Here the subject\u2019s large, heavy lidded eyes, narrow chin, and full lips express his individuality, while his thick, curly hair and neatly trimmed beard indicate the adoption of current Roman fashions. Additional details in gold, symbolizing divinity and eternity, reflect the tremendous expense lavished on this man\u2019s likeness. Read more about Roman mummy portraits on the blog .   Constantine I (306\u201337 CE) had a transformative effect on the later Roman world. He proclaimed the religious toleration of Christianity; reunited the empire under his sole rule after defeating his co-emperor Licinius (reigned 308\u201324 CE); and moved the capital from Rome to Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul), which he renamed Constantinople in his honor. This coin, minted soon after Constantine became sole emperor, depicts him with a youthful, clean-shaven face and a hairstyle of thick locks arranged over his forehead. These features deliberately evoked the appearance of earlier, celebrated emperors, including Augustus (reigned 27 BCE\u201314 CE) and Trajan (reigned 98\u2013117 CE), visually tying his reign to his esteemed predecessors\u2019.   The identity of the woman depicted in this portrait is not known, but her distinguished appearance suggests that she held a prominent position in Roman society. Her elaborate hairstyle, featuring a multi-tiered bun of braids at the back of the head, would have required the assistance of a skilled hairdresser, while her richly textured clothing and intricate headband\u2014carved to suggest that it was studded with gemstones\u2014further attest to her wealth and status. As with many Roman sculptures, this portrait was likely painted in antiquity, giving the subject a more lifelike appearance. Learn more about this bust with this interactive feature .   The Romans frequently incorporated colorful gemstones into their jewelry. This refined gold necklace with a short, delicately woven chain features a single emerald pendant\u2014a rarity in Roman jewelry. At the back is an ornamental fastening in the form of a gold wire rosette with a central garnet stud. Fastenings such as this were a Roman innovation, and they required a fashionable, upswept hairstyle\u2014a clear sign of the wearer\u2019s social standing\u2014in order to be fully appreciated.   This tall, narrow vessel is a particularly elegant example of an alabastron, a type of bottle widely used in the ancient Mediterranean world to hold precious oils and perfumes. While most alabastra have rounded, bulbous bottoms, this example is noteworthy because it tapers to an elongated point, requiring it to be placed in a stand for use. Created using the free-blown technique of glass production, its opaque, deep-blue color and white veining mimic the appearance of costly stone.   Roman houses were frequently adorned with wall paintings and floor mosaics representing foodstuffs and items associated with preparing and serving food. Such imagery was intended to convey messages to visitors about the owner\u2019s wealth and hospitality as well as the quantity and variety of goods available in the house. The bound rooster in this panel, notable for its naturalistic representation and subtle use of color, might have represented the abundance of livestock that was available on the host\u2019s estate, which could be consumed at a meal or sold for a profit.

This relief plaque, which depicts female attendants kneeling around a candelabrum or incense burner, is a type of architectural decoration that was employed primarily in Rome and central Italy in the early Roman Empire. Created in terracotta using molds, these plaques were produced in multiples to form decorative friezes that adorned the walls of public buildings, private residences, temples, and tombs. The plaques depicted subjects ranging from mythological imagery to scenes of daily life, and typically were painted, making them easier to see when viewed from below. This particular plaque preserves microscopic traces of yellow and red pigment, suggesting that it too was once painted.   Following an ancient practice, most Roman homes had domestic shrines, called lararia, which included bronze statuettes of the household gods (the Lares) and other deities venerated by members of the family. This statuette of an unidentified goddess or personified virtue seated on an elaborate throne likely belonged to such a shrine. Scientific analysis suggests that the figure and the throne\u2014although both ancient\u2014were not created as a pair but were found in the same burial site. Presumably, the throne originally belonged to another seated figure displayed in the same setting. ",
