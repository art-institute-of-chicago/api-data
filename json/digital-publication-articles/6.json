    "copy": " I first encountered the work of Malangatana Ngwenya in 2012, just a year after his death, when Lloyd Ellis and his wife, Eva, donated The Fountain of Blood (A fonte de sangue), one of the artist\u2019s early paintings, to the Cleveland Museum of Art (fig. 1).[ref]Lloyd Ellis (1936\u20132019), an art historian and medical doctor, had acquired The Fountain of Blood directly from the artist in Mozambique in 1964, while Ellis served as Vice Consul for the US Foreign Service in Louren\u00e7o Marques (now Maputo). He purchased the work along with The Purification of the Child (fig. 3) and The Poet as a Child (O beb\u00e9 poeta) of 1963. The Fountain of Blood featured in the landmark exhibition for the First International Congress of African Culture (ICAC) that was held in 1962 at the Rhodes National Gallery in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe); see the essay by Felicia Mings in this volume for further discussion of the ICAC and Malangatana\u2019s participation.[/ref] As the resident Africanist art historian, I assisted my colleagues in Contemporary Art with their research on the acquisition. Despite the almost mythical status Malangatana seems to have enjoyed in his native Mozambique, criticism about him written in English remains surprisingly limited. One of the few synthetic sources I benefited from then was art historian Susan Mullin Vogel\u2019s Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art , published in 1991 to accompany the pioneering exhibition of the same name.[ref]See Susan Vogel, ed., Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art , exh. cat. (New York: Center for African Art, 1991).[/ref] In Africa Explores , Vogel briefly discusses Malangatana\u2019s work in a chapter on what she labels \u201cinternational\u201d African art\u2014which, in her understanding, refers to art created by artists who mostly live in cities; who are either academically trained or \u201chave worked under the guidance of a European teacher/patron\u201d; who \u201coften represent their governments in international gatherings\u201d; and whose works \u201care shown in exhibitions, and may be sold to foreigners and to international businesses as well as to the governments and the elite of their own countries.\u201d[ref]Vogel, Africa Explores , 11.[/ref] Though these comments do generally apply to Malangatana and help to distinguish his work from contemporaneous artistic creations of a different kind\u2014whether traditional, \u201cnew functional,\u201d or urban art\u2014they were nevertheless criticized by several reviewers, and the label \u201cinternational\u201d did not stick.[ref]After an earlier negative review, prominent art scholar John Picton recently praised Africa Explores as \u201cpioneering in its scope\u201d; see Picton, \u201cReview: Desperately Seeking Africa, New York, 1991,\u201d The Oxford Art Journal 15, no. 2 (1992): 104\u201312; and Picton \u201cModernism and Modernity in African Art,\u201d in A Companion to Modern African Art , edited by Gitti Salami and Monica Blackmun Vison\u00e0 (Chichester, West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons, 2013), 314. For a trenchant critique of Vogel\u2019s landmark exhibition, see Olu Oguibe, \u201cReview: Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art ,\u201d African Arts 26, no. 1 (Jan. 1993): 16\u201318, 20\u201322.[/ref] I will return to Vogel\u2019s proposition\u2014and its implications, uses, and lacunae\u2014when addressing the \u201cmodernity\u201d of Malangatana\u2019s oeuvre at the end of this essay.[ref]Vogel, Africa Explores , 185. In reconsidering the notion of modernity with reference to Malangatana\u2019s oeuvre, I also hope to offer a modest contribution to the \u201cunpacking of the epistemological foundations of modernity\u201d; Prita Meier, \u201cModernism in Africanist Art History: The Making of a New Discipline,\u201d in The Modernist World , edited by Stephen Ross and Allana C. Lindgren (London and New York: Routledge, 2015), 221.[/ref] The label \u201cmodern\u201d clearly did stick, but not without a measure of ambiguity worth exploring further.   Against the backdrop of the independence movements that cut across the African continent beginning in the late 1950s, a new kind of art emerged, contributing to the formation of unifying national identities that would, ideally, overcome old regional and ethnic divisions. Vogel pointed out that participants in the development of this new art usually demonstrated a special interest in their own ancestral roots and associated rural cultures as a means to reveal some innate \u201cAfricanness\u201d as articulated by the philosophy of N\u00e9gritude, a literary movement that was developed from the 1930s onward by Francophone intellectuals of the African diaspora to raise and cultivate consciousness of black culture. This movement aspired to counter colonial prejudices and propaganda about the inherent dangers of and potential conflicts triggered by \u201ctribalism.\u201d[ref]Vogel, Africa Explores , 178.

See also, among others, Kasfir, Contemporary African Art , chap. 3; and Okeke-Agulu, Postcolonial Modernism , 136. I am using the qualifier \u201canecdotal\u201d in recognition of the fact that, in Mozambique for Malangatana as for African artists elsewhere on the African continent, the reality was probably more complicated and the role of local advocates may have been overlooked. He never challenged the influence of Pancho Guedes on his life and work, however\u2014quite the contrary. It should be noted that the Portuguese colonial system delayed the emergence of modern art in Mozambique and international recognition of its practitioners. See also Okeke-Agulu, Postcolonial Modernism , 6\u20138. That said, as Elizabeth Harney has pointed out, the role of photography in the narrative of modern art in Mozambique remains largely unexplored (personal communication, Oct. 22, 2020).[/ref] The reality of interpersonal relationships was no doubt more complicated as well as heavily constrained by the colonial condition. In Malangatana\u2019s case, the Portuguese architect Am\u00e2ncio d\u2019Alpoim Miranda \u201cPancho\u201d Guedes initially supported his basic formal art training (in a European mode) but then advised Malangatana to steer away from Western-based academic education. He encouraged him to spend time in his rural hometown of Matalana in order to observe the vernacular art and culture of his Ronga ethnic background.[ref]The combination of being self-taught and the particular thematic content of Malangatana\u2019s works\u2014which, as Chika Okeke-Agulu noted, contributed to the impression of a certain \u201ctechnical naivet\u00e9\u201d\u2014possibly added to the appeal of his work with Western critics and foreign collectors in that it reinforced stereotypes of an ancestral African arcadia; Okeke-Agulu, Postcolonial Modernism , 162. See also Vogel, Africa Explores , 179.[/ref] Of course, this recommendation did not temper the artist\u2019s political awareness and activism, as the anti-colonial feelings expressed in The Fountain of Blood and other works make abundantly clear. Nor did it prevent him from seeking visual inspiration in the creations of European and Latin American artists of the past and the present whose imagery he most likely had encountered in the libraries at his disposal, including that of Guedes. Malangatana chose to use the imported media of oil on hardboard and pencil on paper to render themes that appear to draw from the rural life of his ancestral land, together with its local customs and beliefs.[ref]To hear Malangatana himself explain how his work was influenced by traditional Ronga religion and the belief in spirits and the ancestors as well as by Ronga folktales that were passed on to him by his mother, see the documentary based on research by Richard Gray, Homelands (esp. from 16:29 to 19:00 and from 20:08 to 21:50); Adrian Pennink, dir., produced by Diane Lashmore, Arena series (London: BBC Two: 1990).[/ref] As a result, Malangatana, like other modern African artists, as art historians Elizabeth Harney and Ruth B. Phillips have demonstrated recently, found himself \u201cin a double bind, always seeking to be both modern (and freed from the yoke of colonialism) and African (placed, distinctive, native).\u201d[ref]Elizabeth Harney and Ruth B. Phillips, \u201cInside Modernity: Indigeneity, Coloniality, and Modernisms,\u201d in Mapping Modernisms: Art, Indigeneity, and Colonialism , edited by Harney and Phillips (Durham, NC, and London: Duke University Press, 2018), 19.[/ref] Here, partly in response to Malangatana\u2019s own wish for more interpretations of his work along these lines, I will focus on the ethnographic dimension of two of his paintings, both of which display his hallmark expressionistic style and evocative titles: The Scene of the Diviner (A cena da adivinha) from 1961 (fig. 2) and The Witch Doctor or The Purification of the Child (O feiticeiro or A purifica\u00e7\u00e3o da crian\u00e7a) from 1962 (fig. 3).[ref]See M\u00e1rio Pissarra\u2019s essay in this volume, n30. Though Pissarra has opted to describe some of Malangatana\u2019s oeuvre as \u201canthropological,\u201d I favor the adjective \u201cethnographic\u201d instead, as it is the descriptive method that informs anthropology. I am cognizant of criticisms of the use of the term \u201cethnography\u201d in the context of the naming of museums of \u201cthe Other\u201d against the backdrop of their colonial histories, but I believe that is not pertinent to the present analysis; see, e.g., John Picton, \u201cMuseum Ethnography, Current Art, Africa,\u201d Journal of Museum Ethnography 12 (May 2000): 109\u201314.[/ref]   I should point out that when I use \u201cexpressionistic\u201d to describe Malangatana\u2019s style, I am not referring to the European modernist or avant-garde art historical movement of the early twentieth century that originated in Germany, but rather to the more general depiction of subjective feelings and personal emotions through exaggeration, distortion, and fantasy. What I have in mind are the varied expressionistic styles of artists from diverse places and times that the artist himself admired, such as the twentieth-century Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros (see fig. 4) and the Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch, known for the dense compositions he produced around 1500 (see fig. 5).[ref]See Richard Gray, \u201cMalangatana: The Lost Interview,\u201d in Malangatana: The Matalana Visionary , 20th February\u20135th April 2014, Gallery of African Art (GAFRA), London, by Elsbeth Court, C. Bendu Cooper, Eri Otite, Malangatana, et al., exh. cat. (London: GAFRA Art Publishing, 2014), 83\u201384. See also Polly Savage, \u201cMalangatana Valente Ngwenya,\u201d in Making Art in Africa 1960 \u2013 2010 , edited by Polly Savage (Farnham, Surrey, UK, and Burlington, VT: Lund Humphries, 2014), 251. Referring to the two paintings included in the Center for African Art\u2019s exhibition of 1991 (cats. 108\u20139), one of which is The Black Pope and His Calabash from Childhood (Papa Negro e sua caba\u00e7a de inf\u00e2ncia) (fig. 2 in Pissarra), Vogel also writes that \u201cMalangatana paints in an expressionistic style all his own\u201d ( Africa Explores , 185).[/ref]   It is difficult to know if Guedes had any personal knowledge of the indigenous culture he was pushing his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to prioritize. Malangatana belonged to the Ronga (or Rhonga) ethnic group whose members speak the southeastern Bantu language known as Xir(h)onga, which is prevalent in the region south of Maputo; the area encompasses his native village, Matalana, and extends into South Africa.[ref]See Memory Holloway, \u201cMalangatana: Viagem Salvadora , Where Blood and Tears Run,\u201d in Transnational Africas: Visual, Material and Sonic Cultures of Lusophone Africa , edited by Christopher Larkosh, Mario Pereira, and Memory Holloway, double issue of Portuguese Literary & Cultural Studies 30/31 (2017): 122n8.[/ref] The earliest dictionary of the Ronga language was published in 1896 by the Swiss missionary Henri Alexandre Junod, who considered it a dialect of Tsonga (which he spelled \u201cThonga\u201d).[ref]Henri Alexandre Junod, Grammaire ronga suivie d\u2019un manuel de conversation et d\u2019un vocabulaire ronga-portugais-fran\u00e7ais-anglais (Lausanne, Switzerland: Georges Bridel, 1896). The author of many publications, including an ethnographic study on the Ronga, his magnum opus is considered to be The Life of a South African Tribe , 2 vols. (Neuchatel, Switzerland: Attinger Fr\u00e8res, 1912\u201313). Junod taught at the Swiss Mission School at Matalana that Malangatana attended and may have been one of the artist\u2019s instructors; see Gray, \u201cThe Lost Interview,\u201d 74.[/ref] Traditional visual arts associated with the ethnic label \u201cRonga\u201d are barely known among European and American students of African art.[ref]The materials that Junod acquired in situ and that are now in the Ethnographic Museum of Neuchatel, illustrated in Les Ba-Ronga. \u00c9tude ethnographique sur les indig\u00e8nes de la baie de Delagoa , Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Neuch\u00e2teloise de G\u00e9ographie, 10 (Neuchatel, Switzerland: Attinger Fr\u00e8res, 1898), 233, include some sculptural and even figurative examples but most seem like knickknacks of the tourist type (fig. 6). And the headrest and snuff container should probably be attributed to the Tsonga or maybe even the Shona rather than to the Ronga; see Junod, The Life of a South African Tribe , 128.[/ref] Headrests, staffs, snuff containers, and pipes populate some African art collections in South Africa, Europe, and the United States (see, for example, fig. 6), but these are not the types of visual arts that appear in Malangatana\u2019s paintings; there we instead see gourds and ceramics, some decorated with painted geometric designs, as well as textiles and beaded adornments. Though I was not able to identify any of the latter items in the artist\u2019s personal collection of Mozambican arts and crafts in his house and studio in Maputo when my colleagues and I visited in the summer of 2019, an in-depth examination of the collections and archives of the ethnology museums in Maputo and Lisbon may bring similar objects to light.   While some of Malangatana\u2019s paintings may feature depictions of Ronga material culture, at least two of them clearly refer to local practices. The Purification of the Child (fig. 3) depicts a healing session in which a man and a woman bring their bleeding child to a traditional therapist, or curandeiro .[ref]The painting was donated by the Ellises to the Oberlin College Library in 2012 in memory of Eduardo Chivambo Mondlane, the \u201cFather of Mozambican Independence\u201d and founding president of the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). A close friend of Malangatana, Mondlane graduated from Oberlin in 1953 before earning an MA from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, and his PhD from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.[/ref] The painting has also been identified as The Witch Doctor , but the Portuguese translation, feiticeiro , with its pejorative connotations including implied references to superstition and \u201chocus pocus\u201d magic, does not convey the local prestige of this profession.[ref]For a critical assessment of the terms \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201cfetish\u201d as they have been used with regard to Africa and its arts, see especially Suzanne Preston Blier, \u201cTruth and Seeing: Magic, Custom, and Fetish in Art History,\u201d in Africa and the Disciplines: The Contributions of Research in Africa to the Social Sciences and Humanities , edited by Robert H. Bates, V. Y. Mudimbe, and Jean O\u2019Barr (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1993), 143\u201352.[/ref] Moreover, according to Junod\u2019s dictionary, the two occupations are apparently distinct; the therapist-healer is locally known as nanga (plur. tinanga ), while ngoma (plur. bangoma ) is the Ronga term for diviner but also for what is translated as feiticeiro in Portuguese and as \u201cmagician\u201d in English.[ref]Junod, Grammaire ronga , 80 and 75.[/ref] According to scholar Richard Gray, this painting \u201cdemonstrates how Malangatana drew on specific, localized experiences from his rural childhood.\u201d[ref]Richard Gray, \u201c\u2018You Must Love What We Do,\u2019 Malangatana: Mozambique Modern ,\u201d MutualArt , May 8, 2020, https://www.mutualart.com/Article/You-Must-Love-What-We-Do--Malangatana--M/EA37C047D91E5188 .[/ref] From interviews with the artist's niece, Maria Alda Ngwenya, who is a local nanga , he learned that the scene represents the healing session of a child who has been bitten by a snake; the pot and gourd flanking the central figure would hold medicine and an antivenom. Gray further identified the blue figures as maleficent spirit-monsters known locally as xipokho , which only the nanga can see. The painting would thus demonstrate the local population\u2019s reliance on tinanga rather than Western medical doctors, but it could also bear some autobiographical meaning for the artist, whose own mother was treated by tinanga when she suffered from mental health troubles from 1947 to 1951.[ref]See Gray, \u201cThe Lost Interview,\u201d 74. Gray transcribed the term for a traditional healer as \u201cnyanga.\u201d[/ref] Though they were realized barely a year apart, The Scene of the Diviner of 1961 is painted in a very different style than The Purification of the Child . It portrays a village scene that includes a female diviner ( ngoma ) with many kinds of adornment, including a braided hairstyle, filed teeth, and accessories. In Bantu-speaking Africa divination is a widely used method of communicating with the supernatural that may reveal the causes of misfortune and conflict through spirit mediumship. Like the owls that appear in The Purification of the Child , snakes often feature in the folklore of Bantu speakers in southern Africa, where they function as messengers for the ancestors, who continue to influence the lives of their descendants and intervene whenever conflict requires their assistance.[ref]For an early source on the subject, see the foundational article by Wilfrid D. Hambly, \u201cThe Serpent in African Belief and Custom,\u201d American Anthropologist n.s., no. 31 (1929): 655\u201366. [/ref] Further interviews with local tinanga and a thorough reading of Junod\u2019s many ethnographic publications would likely deepen the interpretation of paintings with similar thematic references. Should these two paintings be read as realistic depictions of the artist\u2019s life experience, as one of his contemporaries, the architect and writer Julian Beinart, believed, or as expressions of Malangatana\u2019s ambivalence toward indigenous spirit-based beliefs and practices, reflecting his liminal position between his Ronga culture and that of the ruling Portuguese colonials? Both in his essay in this volume and in his dissertation, M\u00e1rio Pissarra argues that the seemingly realistic documentation of some local practices and rural scenes was likely meant as a form of criticism of the traditional past.[ref]See also M\u00e1rio de Andrade Pissarra, \u201cLocating Malangatana: Decolonization, Aesthetics and the Roles of an Artist in a Changing Society\u201d (PhD thesis, University of Cape Town, 2019), chap. 5. Even The Small Dentist ( O pequeno dentista) (1961), which, according to Pancho Guedes\u2019s account, depicts the artist\u2019s lived experience of a bloody tooth extraction\u2014on April 9, 1961, the night before his first solo show in Maputo opened\u2014could, in Pissarra\u2019s estimation, speak to Malangatana\u2019s ambivalent attitude towards Western/European medicine; see his contribution in this volume, para 21; and Am\u00e2ncio d\u2019Alpoim Guedes, \u201cRemembering the Painter Malangatana Valente Ngwenia [ sic ] When He Was Still Young,\u201d in Malangatana Valente Ngwenya , edited by J\u00falio Navarro (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: Mkuki na Nyota Publishers, 2003), 13.[/ref] Scenes like those of the diviner and the healer would, in Pissarra\u2019s opinion, also derive from the artist\u2019s introduction to traditional health practitioners in the course of treating his mother\u2019s illness. While we do not wish to deny the satirical undertones that may be embedded in some of these works about rural Mozambican life, any criticism in those paintings is at best obliquely expressed. It is, however, equally difficult to substantiate the idea that the artist assumed the role of an ethnographer in a scientific sense, and that his paintings and drawings could serve as an objective window on his native culture. What Malangatana appears to be presenting in both Scene of the Diviner and Purification of the Child is a generic and idealized view of a reimagined rural Africa, a pre-colonial locale where traditional culture and art operate in a seemingly timeless past, unaffected by European contact. Indeed, as Susan Vogel has observed more generally, his scenes lack any material reference to modern Western culture: no wristwatches, no T-shirts, no plastic sandals.[ref]Vogel, Africa Explores , 189.[/ref] What is depicted instead is what the prominent intellectual V. Y. Mudimbe has famously described as the \u201c idea of Africa,\u201d an intellectual construct that rests at least in part on invention.[ref]V. Y. Mudimbe, The Idea of Africa (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press; London: James Currey, 1994). See also Hassan, \u201cAfrican Modernism,\u201d 453.[/ref] In closing, then, we can revisit Vogel\u2019s proposition that there may be some continuity between the categories of, on the one hand, traditional African art, and on the other, modern African art, which she labels \u201cinternational.\u201d[ref]Vogel, Africa Explores , 187\u201390 and 194. Elizabeth Harney urges us to consider the simultaneity of these different categories (personal communication, Oct. 25, 2020).[/ref] Even though they are distinct in medium and typically also in form, both categories are about expressing ideas and concepts rather than about the imitation of nature in a literal sense. But what also ties modern and traditional African art together is that they are both functional. To be sure, their respective functions are quite different in that the sociopolitical and sometimes moral dimensions\u2014as well as the autobiographical references\u2014that define the former are only very rarely present in the latter. But the imagery of both categories is also mostly collective rather than personal in nature and therefore serves the group rather than the individual. These reflections compel me to ask a final question: what makes Malangatana\u2019s oeuvre modern or even modernist, as many critics and this project have treated it? On a basic level, his work can obviously be labeled \u201cmodern\u201d because it was a novelty in both its medium and its subject matter; it appears to have been radically different from any local form of visual artistic expression that preceded it. In the late 1950s, it was a new development in the arts of Mozambique when Malangatana painted on hardboard or on canvas and drew on paper; he was similarly innovative when depicting traditional cultural scenes from an ethnographic perspective and representing social and political events from an historiographic angle. But these emerging practices did not by themselves constitute artistic modernism in the Western, Euro-American sense. We may find it helpful to recall an observation made by archaeologist and art critic John Picton with respect to the Latin etymology of the word \u201cmodern.\u201d He pointed out that modernus refers to \u201cjust now,\u201d and thus modernity is always related to a particular time and place: \u201cmodernity here is not the same as modernity there,\u201d and \u201cmodernity now is not the same as modernity then.\u201d[ref]Picton, \u201cModernism and Modernity,\u201d 317.[/ref] Thus, and contrary to what is most commonly argued in Africanist art historical circles, there may be more to be gained if we emphasize the modernity of Malangatana\u2019s art than if we try to align it with the Western European and North American avant-garde art movement most would identify as modernism.[ref]See, e.g., \u201cArt Term: Modernism,\u201d tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/m/modernism , accessed Oct. 29, 2020.[/ref] This holds despite my earlier characterization of Malangatana\u2019s style as expressionistic in a generic artistic sense. Indeed, as art historian Salah M. Hassan has pointed out, the \u201clong history of exclusion\u201d and the Eurocentric bias of the art historical discourse, with its evolution toward increased abstraction, complicates any \u201ctheorizing of modernity and modernism outside the West.\u201d[ref]Hassan, \u201cAfrican Modernism,\u201d 459. See also Dipesh Chakrabarty, Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000), 27; Walter D. Mignolo, \u201cThe Geopolitics of Knowledge and the Colonial Difference,\u201d The South Atlantic Quarterly 101, no. 1 (Winter 2002): 62; and Meier, \u201cModernism in Africanist Art History,\u201d 217\u201318.[/ref] Though some scholars have called for us to liberate the term \u201cmodernism\u201d from its exclusionary, Eurocentric connotations and have argued for a pluralistic and flexible approach to modernism, I believe we should label the artistic accomplishments of Malangatana and most of his contemporaries simply as modern, not modernist\u2014albeit with the geographic specification \u201cAfrican.\u201d[ref]Obviously, this does not take away from the cosmopolitan nature of their life and work, or from the fact that they may have sought and found inspiration in the ideas and realizations of their historical antecedents in Europe and on the American continent.[/ref] In so doing, I concur with art historian James Elkins that it is more appropriate and productive to describe the paintings and drawings of African modern artists \u201con their own terms\u201d and to focus on their local critical reception.[ref]See James Elkins, \u201cWriting About Modernist Painting Outside Western Europe and North America,\u201d in Compression vs. Expression: Containing and Explaining the World\u2019s Art , edited by John Onians (Williamstown, MA: Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, 2006), 195\u2013201.[/ref] In order to truly achieve the desired \u201cdecentering\u201d of innovations in the arts across the globe, though, I argue that it would be more advisable to reserve \u201cmodernism\u201d for the progression of art movements in Europe and North America.[ref]See also Charles Harrison, \u201cModernism,\u201d in Critical Terms for Art History , edited by Robert S. Nelson and Richard Shiff (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 142\u201355. Harrison states that \u201cthere are few terms upon which the weight of implication, of innuendo, and of aspiration bears down so heavily as it now does upon modernism\u201d (142) and that \u201cthere is always a strong possibility of confusion in art-historical discussions of modernism\u201d (143). Underscoring that \u201cthe time of modernity is teleological\u201d and that \u201cits home lies in the West,\u201d Keith Moxey has recently argued that \u201cmultiple modernities is an oxymoron, a logical contradiction\u201d; Moxey, Visual Time: The Image in History (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2013), 11. However, for an opposing view, see Sylvester Okwunodu Ogbechie, \u201cInterrogating African Modernity: Art, Cultural Politics, and Global Identities,\u201d Critical Interventions 2, nos. 3/4 (Spring 2009): 1\u20136. On \u201cdecentering,\u201d see Partha Mitter, \u201cDecentering Modernism: Art History and Avant-Garde Art from the Periphery,\u201d The Art Bulletin 90, no. 4 (Dec. 2008): 531\u201348.[/ref] Western modernism is so entrenched with European colonial hegemony and imperialist ideology that it would be futile to attempt to dissociate art from time or to disentangle the asymmetrical power relations that underlie it. Like Vogel I am, however, keen to absorb the \u201cinternational\u201d into \u201cmodern,\u201d to allow for the existence of a synchronic \u201ctraditional modern\u201d African art. And, by analogy, I would apply the same rationale to the term \u201ccontemporary,\u201d acknowledging that what is called \u201cinternational\u201d or \u201ctraditional contemporary\u201d African art today will become modern tomorrow.[ref]For some further reflection on the shifting meanings of the term \u201ccontemporary,\u201d see Vogel, Africa Explores , 182; Kasfir, Contemporary African Art , 9\u201310; and Picton, \u201cModernism and Modernity,\u201d 316. While the \u201ccontemporary\u201d African art category would currently begin in 1980, the origins of the \u201cmodern\u201d category are typically situated in the 1950s, in the aftermath of World War II, but occasionally pushed back to the 1920s.
